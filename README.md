This recursive screenscraper (recursive.py) does three things:
-pulls all statistics in the body of a webpage
-pulls all lists in the body of a webpage
-pulls links in the body of a webpage

Once it has pulled relevant links on the page, it performs the same three operations on those links ad inifinatum. The single page scraper (singlepage.py) performs these operations on a single page and then stops.
