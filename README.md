The recursive screenscraper (recursive.py) does three things:
1) pulls all statistics in the body of a webpage
2) pulls all lists in the body of a webpage
3) pulls links in the body of a webpage

Once it has pulled relevant links on the page, it performs the same three operations on those links ad inifinatum. The single page scraper (singlepage.py) performs these operations on a single page and then stops.
